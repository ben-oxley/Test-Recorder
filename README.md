# Test-Recorder
Test recorder for generating testfx tests

This has been generated as a response to the Visual Studio coded UI test runner 
in order to allow people who haven't written coded UI tests before to get a feel 
for how the tests need to be written by recording actions.

Built to write tests which are compliant with the [TestFX Library](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX "TestFX Library")
